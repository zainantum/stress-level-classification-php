# stress-level-classification-php
This script is based on my final project:
<a href='https://j-ptiik.ub.ac.id/index.php/j-ptiik/article/view/5783'>Stress Level Classification Based on Tweets on Twitter Account using Improved k-Nearest Neighbor Method and Chi-square</a>

<p>For text processing you can use Library Sastrawi(Bahasa Indonesia). This script still need more improvement and efficiency. I'm consulting with psychologist to make label for data training with level rendah, sedang, berat</p>
